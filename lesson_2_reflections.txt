when you initialize a repository, it creates an empty git repository.

the staging area is where the files are added before the changes 
are committed. Working directory is the directory that has the files
you might be committing. The staging area allows it so you dont have 
to commit every file in the working directory.

you can stage changes one by one then commit them so you have
one commit per logical change.

a situation where branches could help keep your history organized 
is if you wanted to try out an experimental feature, this wouldn't
affect the master branch (your main working version).

diagrams help you visualize the branch structure so you can
easily see what commits are accessible from where, and where the
branches start off from.

merging two branches together result in an addition of the code at the tip of both branches, it is represented in the diagram the way it is because the new merged commit has access to both parent branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
