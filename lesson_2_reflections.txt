when you initialize a repository, it creates an empty git repository.

the staging area is where the files are added before the changes 
are committed. Working directory is the directory that has the files
you might be committing. The staging area allows it so you dont have 
to commit every file in the working directory.

you can stage changes one by one then commit them so you have
one commit per logical change.
