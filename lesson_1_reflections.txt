It makes it much easier unlike having to look through 
each line manually.

Having access to the history makes it easy to see the 
changes you've made and why, so you dont make the same 
mistakes when you run into similar problems in future.

Manually committing means user error is possible where you 
forget to commit a change you've made. It also means you have
control over when a commit is made and thus all commits makes sense.

This is most likely because in Git, you're more likely to have 
multiple relating files whereas in google docs, the files 
are less likely to be related.

you can use git log to view all previous commits to a repository
you can use git diff to view the difference between commits in the
repository.

Using version control gives you more freedom to make changes without
having to worry about breaking something because you can always
revert to a previous commit and se exactly what went wrong.

I want to use git to version control all my future projects from now on.
