When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
so you can collaborate with others and also, you can work from different location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so you dont make some changes public yet before they are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork are copies of an existing repository from one github profile to another. 
clones are copies from github to your local repository.
branches are commits which are sepereate from the master branch of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
this way you can tell if there have been changes to the remote from the last know state
